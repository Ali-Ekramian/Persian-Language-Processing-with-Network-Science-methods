# Persian-Language-Processing-with-Network-Science-methods
Persian is a rich and complex language that poses many challenges for natural language processing (NLP). In this project, we apply network science methods to analyze the structure and properties of Persian language. We construct co-occurrence graphs from large corpora of Persian texts, where nodes represent words and edges represent their co-occurrence frequency. We then use modularity detection algorithms to identify clusters of words that belong to the same semantic or syntactic category. We also compute various network measures, such as degree distribution, centrality, assortivity and clustering coefficient, to characterize the features and patterns of Persian language. By using network science methods, we aim to gain a deeper understanding of the linguistic phenomena and regularities in Persian language.
